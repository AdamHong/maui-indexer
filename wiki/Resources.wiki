<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

Apart from the three collections listed in the MultiplyIndexedData, Maui was also tested on several term assignment collections, where each document had a single set of manually assigned topics.


==FAO-780 data set for term assignment== 

  * [http://maui-indexer.googlecode.com/files/fao780.tar.gz Download FAO-780]

This data set contains 780 documents with terms from Agrovoc assigned by professionals. When using this data set, please cite Medelyan (2009) or Medelyan and Witten (2008), see [Publications]. 


==Other data sets on the web==

[http://aye.comp.nus.edu.sg/downloads/keyphraseCorpus/ NUS Keyphrase Corpus] can be used for training and testing keyphrase extaction and tagging. To use it with Maui, the data first needs to be converted into the required format.


[http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddshp584_46gqkkjng4 SemEval-2010 Keyphrase Extraction] will soon publish their data for the participants of the shared task. This data set will be similar to the NUS Keyphrase corpus.

==Vocabularies==

For term assignment, a number of vocabularies in SKOS format are available on the web:

  * [http://id.loc.gov/authorities/search/ Library of Congress Subject Headings LSCH]
  * [http://thesauri.cs.vu.nl/eswc06/mesh/rdf/meshdata.rdf Medical Subject Headings thesaurus MeSH]

Please note:
Maui user [http://groups.google.com/group/kea-and-maui-support/browse_thread/thread/d290b81c653249e2# Amrita] recommends to use [http://code.google.com/p/hive-mrc/wiki/MeshToSKOS HIVE to convert original MeSH vocabulary into SKOS].

  * FAO’s agricultural thesaurus Agrovoc: [http://www.fao.org/agrovoc/ general info] and [http://aims.fao.org/en/website/Download/sub download site].
